# Odin-Recipes

This is asimple webisite that will have a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. 
I will be adding future css to this website to make it look more presentable

Learned: 
- basic html
- using <a> to link to an absolute webpage that has the attirbute target="_blank" (opens a new tab to display the page) could have cybersecurity risks. To prevent this risk add rel="noopener noreferrer". Noopener prevents the original page the users used to open to the new tab to no be effected/redirected to a new page. noreferrer prevents information to be sent to the newly opened tab.
- How to write proper git commit messages, include a tag(what you did) and a clear title of what you have accomplished
